# Cefiderocol-Meta-analysis
## 🧾 Project Overview
This repository contains the code and supporting materials for a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of cefiderocol combination versus monotherapy in infections caused by multidrug-resistant and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The meta-analysis focuses on outcomes such as mortality, clinical cure, and microbiological eradication. Analyses include forest plots, influence diagnostics, and contour-enhanced funnel plots.

## 📂 Data
The file `Meta-analysis Cefiderocol_github.xlsx` contains study-level data used for the meta-analysis. The following table explains the meaning of each column:

| **Column Name**                   | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `First author, year` | Name of the first author and publication year, used to identify the study.     |
| `Type of study`                  | Study design (e.g., RCT, retrospective, prospective).                          |
| `Country`                        | Country where the study was conducted.                                         |
| `Mono/multicentric`             | Indicates whether the study was monocentric or multicentric.                   |
| `Target Pathogen`               | Pathogen targeted in the study (e.g., CRAB, MDR).                              |
| `Outcome`                        | Clinical endpoint reported (e.g., mortality, clinical cure, microbiological cure). |
| `No. of patients (total)`       | Total number of patients included in the study.                                |
| `ABT mainly used in combo (>20%)` | Antibiotics used in combination therapy when it accounted for >20% of cases.   |
| `Fav outcome combo`             | Number of favorable outcomes in the combination therapy group.                 |

| `adjusted OR`                   | Adjusted odds ratio for the outcome, if reported.                              |
| `aOR lower`                     | Lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the adjusted OR.                |
| `aOR upper`                     | Upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the adjusted OR.                |
| `Analysis mode`                 | Type of statistical analysis used (e.g., univariate, multivariate).            |
## 📐 Methods
Random-effects models were applied using the restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator to pool odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes (mortality, clinical cure, microbiological cure). When available, adjusted effect sizes (adjusted ORs with 95% confidence intervals) were pooled using the inverse variance method; otherwise, crude odds ratios were calculated and included in the analysis.

Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-squared test and the I² statistic. A 95% prediction interval was included to reflect the expected range of treatment effects in future studies. Publication bias was evaluated using contour-enhanced funnel plots, and Egger’s test was not performed due to the limited number of studies per outcome (n < 10), which limits statistical power. Influence diagnostics included Baujat plots and leave-one-out analysis to explore robustness and study-level effects on heterogeneity and pooled estimates.

All analyses were conducted in R using the `meta`, `dmetar`, and `tidyverse` packages. Visualizations were automatically generated and saved as high-resolution `.png` files for each outcome.
## ▶️ How to Run the Analysis
To reproduce the meta-analysis and generate all plots go in **RStudio**, go to: **File** → **New Project** → **Version Control** → **Git**

Paste your repo URL:
```arduino
https://github.com/mat194/Cefiderocol-Meta-analysis.git
```
Choose where to save it locally and click Create Project
RStudio will handle the clone, and open the repo in a new session.
Open and run `Script.R` in R or RStudio. This script will:
- Load the data
- Perform the meta-analyses
- Generate forest plots, funnel plots, and influence diagnostics for each outcome 
- Save all plots in the `Plots/` folder

Ensure that the `Data/` folder exist in your project root.
